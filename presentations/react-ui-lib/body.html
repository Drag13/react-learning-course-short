    <h2>Purpose</h2>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Speed up the development</h3>

    <p class="left">Ui libraries provide you with good set of already working components</p>
    <p class="left">It's much faster to <i>npm i</i> then code, code, code</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Cover edge cases</h3>

    <p class="left">Good ui libraries already faced tricky cases like accessibility, performance, etc</p>
    <p class="left">
      If bug not exists, you will not need to fix it
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>You might not need UI library if</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>It requires <strong>deep</strong> customization</li>
      <li class="fragment fade-up">You need only one single component from the library and will not need more </li>
      <li class="fragment fade-up">The component you needed is really very simple</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>However, you should reconsider your decision if you need</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Grid - making your own grid is a huge pain</li>
      <li class="fragment fade-up">Datepicker - working with date is a huge pain</li>
      <li class="fragment fade-up">Modals - accessibility will kill you</li>
      <li class="fragment fade-up">Specific selects - accessibility, mobiles, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to choose</h2>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Gather crucial requirements</h3>

    <p class="left">No reason to use Material UI if your styles not "materials"</p>
    <p class="left">No reason to use UI library if you need responsiveness and lib doesn't support it</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Collect options</h3>

    <p>Collect at least 3 libraries that fits your requirements</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Most important aspects</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>It should be alive - eg some commits done during the previous month</li>
      <li class="fragment fade-up">It should be well-known - at least 1000 stars, more is betters</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Nice to have aspects</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Small size or tree shaking</li>
      <li class="fragment fade-up">Small amount of opened issues</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Pick the best one and to PoC with it</h3>

    <p class="left">
      Don't waste much time with PoC - check only critical requirements
    </p>

    <p class="left">
      No reason to use select without async search when this is a must
    </p>
