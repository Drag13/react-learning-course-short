    <h3>When doing pet project you will not have much time for a detailed planning</h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>Set one (maximum two) goals</li>
      <li class="fragment fade-up">Note nice to have features somewhere just not to forget</li>
      <li class="fragment fade-up">
        Categorize all work as must have (the solution is usesless without such features) and nice
        to have
      </li>
      <li class="fragment fade-up">Implement <strong>only</strong> must have features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pitfalls</h2>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Underestimates</h3>

    <p>The first pet project should be something around two weeks 2 hours each day of work</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Adding non crucial features</h3>

    <p>Implement only that features that absolutely needed for the project</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Pausing</h3>
    <p>Better to work 2 hours each day rather than 6 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 0</p>
