    <h2>What is a Pet Project</h2>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What is the main difference between Pet and Learning Project?</h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Main goal for a learning project - is to generate some knowledge</h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Main goal for a pet project - is to be fun <span class="fragment fade-up">?</span></h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>To me - main goal for a pet project - is to be both fun and <u>released</u></h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Considering Pet project - always think about the release</h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>And what about the demo project?</h3>
    <p>
      A demo project is something that should demonstrates your skills. It should not be fun or
      released. Just show how good you are.

    <h2>Hot to pick a theme</h2>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Good theme is super important</h3>
    <p>
      The good theme will support you during the development and attract other people after the
      release
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Never pick a PetProject that doesn't resonate with your heart</h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Two ways to pick a good theme</h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Something fun</h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Something painful</h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Example - the Shooter Log</h3>

    <h2>Planing</h2>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Pet project is a race against yourself - until you get bored and tired</h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>When doing pet project you will not have much time for a detailed planning</h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>Set one (maximum two) goals</li>
      <li class="fragment fade-up">
        Categorize all work as must have (the solution is useless without such features) and nice to
        have
      </li>
      <li class="fragment fade-up">Implement <strong>only</strong> must have features</li>
      <li class="fragment fade-up">Note nice to have features somewhere just not to forget</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>For the first 2-3 projects</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Not more than 16-20 hours</li>
      <li>Not more than 2-3 weeks</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Remember - something unplanned will happen, be prepared to X3 time</h3>

  <section><h2>Time management tips</h2></section>
  <section>
    <h3>Set aside some dedicated time for your project</h3>
    <p>Pet project is not something unserious</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Work on a regular basis</h3>

    <p>Better to work 2 hours every day, rather than 6 -> 2 -> 0</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Focus on a one task at a time</h3>
    <p>Define -> Code -> Commit -> Relax</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Pitfalls</h2>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Underestimates</h3>

    <p>Don't try to create a new FaceBook (at least from the first attempt)</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Avoid adding non crucial features</h3>

    <p>Implement only the features that are absolutely needed for the project</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Minimize infrastructure work</h3>
    <p>For the small projects, hard automatization takes more time than actually coding</p>
    <p>Release should be you primary focus</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Pausing</h3>
    <p>Work regularly and avoid pause</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Abandoning</h3>
    <p>Abandoning project might lead you to the lack of self-esteem</p>
    <p>Thus, first project better to be small and 99% doable</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Turn it into work</h3>
    <p>Pet project HAVE to be fun, it should makes you proud and happy</p>
  </section>
</section>

<section>
  <section>
    <h2>What about:</h2>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Team work</h3>
    <p>The same except each new teammate increase general velocity for 0.8 then previous</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Things after release</h3>
    <p>
      Don't be shy to promote your project. You will gain extra experience, your first users and,
      might be even become a unicorn!
